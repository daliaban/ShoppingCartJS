Hello,

First of all, the page does not look like the ones you had provided, apologies for that. Special apology for the logo :-)

I was unable to open the photoshop psd file, hence had to rely on the only image I had.

I did not have any icons/images provided there, hence have used my own.

Also, I admit the page is not fully responsive, again apologies, probably I highly depend on Bootstrap for a responsive layout and creating them solely by hand was a challenge.

I hope I am able to furnish all the functionalities provided in the test. Again, I would have made a much better solution with Angular JS.

The page can be navigated by the bottom hand navigation bar. For obvious reasons, all data are mocked on HTML and respective divs are shown/hidden based on nav click.

Each page should show one different item.

The User's location is captured using a third party service which checks users IP address to determine which country they belong to and shows that under 'Your Location'.

Add to basket adds the item to cart. You can add one item multiple times.

The number of items in cart should show how many items are currently in cart.

The total to pay = cart value + Â£10 shipping charge

You can add items to favourites by clicking on the favorites icon. One item can be added to favorites only once.

The number of items in favourites should show on the header.

Items can be deleted from both Cart and favorites.

The cart items and favorites are saved in session storage, hence can be retrieved on page refresh.
