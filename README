This Shopping Cart is done without using any framework / libraries except jQuery and plain javascript.

The page can be navigated by the bottom hand navigation bar. All data are mocked on HTML and respective divs are shown/hidden based on nav click.

Each page should show one different item.

The User's location is captured using a third party service which checks users IP address to determine which country they belong to and shows that under 'Your Location'.

Add to basket adds the item to cart. You can add one item multiple times.

The number of items in cart should show how many items are currently in cart.

The total to pay = cart value + Â£10 shipping charge.

You can add items to favourites by clicking on the favorites icon. One item can be added to favorites only once.
Once added, that icon would turn red to indicate that the item is in favorites.

The number of items in favourites should show on the header.

Items can be deleted from both Cart and favorites.

The cart items and favorites are saved in session storage, hence can be retrieved on page refresh.

The test coverage could be found under coverage/index.html.

The connect server could be used to host the application.
Please run 'npm install' and then 'grunt serve' to start the application.
